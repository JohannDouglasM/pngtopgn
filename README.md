# pngtopgn

React Native Expo app that recognizes chess positions from top-down photos and converts them to FEN/PGN. Everything runs on-device (no API calls).

## Pipeline

Photo → **Corner Detection** (find 4 board corners) → **Perspective Warp** → **Square Classification** (13 classes per square) → FEN → PGN/Lichess

## Current State

### Corner Detection — ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
- **Hybrid ML model**: ResNet-18 with 3-channel input (grayscale + Canny edges + square center heatmap)
- **Best val_dist: 0.0198** (~60px mean error on 3072px images, ~2% diagonal)
- Trained on ChessReD2K (1,447 train / 330 val)
- Generalizes well to user's own photos (0.0200 norm_dist on 5 test images)
- Autoresearch loop exploring hyperparameters (lr, dropout, head architecture, loss, augmentation, etc.)

### CV Board Detection (detect_board_v5.py) — REFERENCE
- 100% detection rate on 600 images across multiple datasets
- Pure OpenCV, no ML model needed
- Used as reference/fallback, being superseded by ML corner detector

### Square Classifier — NEEDS WORK
- ResNet-18 trained on ChessReD2K tournament board squares
- 13 classes: 6 white pieces + 6 black pieces + empty
- ~92% accuracy on ChessReD2K validation set
- ~65% accuracy on other chess sets (domain gap problem)

### On-Device Inference (src/ml/inference.ts)
- Uses onnxruntime-react-native for model execution
- jpeg-js for pure-JS pixel extraction
- JS homography implementation (no native OpenCV dependency)
- Requires Expo dev client build (not Expo Go)

## Models

Exported as ONNX (~43MB each), stored in `assets/models/` (gitignored):
- **Corner model**: ResNet-18 → 8 floats (4 normalized corner coordinates). Input: 384x384 x 3ch
- **Square classifier**: ResNet-18 → 13 classes. Input: 100x200 (WxH)

## Training Data

All in `training/data/` (gitignored):
- **ChessReD2K**: 1,447 train / 330 val / 306 test images with corner + piece annotations
- **chess-dataset**: 500 real photos of green/white vinyl board with FEN labels (originals + preprocessed)
- **User images**: 5 manually annotated board photos

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Two-stage pipeline** (detect corners → classify squares) — each stage independently improvable
2. **3-channel hybrid input** for corner detection — grayscale for appearance, Canny for edges, heatmap for board structure
3. **On-device only** — no cloud APIs, all inference via ONNX Runtime
4. **Chesscog-style square cropping** — variable height/width margins, horizontal flip for left columns, bottom-aligned padding
